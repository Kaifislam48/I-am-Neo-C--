/* Vivetha was tasked with developing a basic calculator program that performs arithmetic operations on two numbers. The program should have a class called "Operation" with the following functionalities:


Create a class named "Operation" that has two private member variables named "a" and "b". Define public member functions for the classes "get", "sum", "difference", "product", "division", and "modulus". The "get" function should prompt the user to enter values for "a" and "b" and store them in the private member variables.


    The "sum" function should compute and output the sum of "a" and "b".
    The "difference" function should compute and output the difference between "a" and "b".
    The "product" function should compute and output the product of "a" and "b".
    The "division" function should compute and output the division of "a" by "b". If "b" is zero, the function should output an error message.
    The "modulus" function should compute and output the modulus of "a" and "b". If "b" is zero, the function should output an error message.


In the main function, create an object of the "Operation" class and call its member functions to perform the necessary arithmetic operations on the values entered by the user.


Note: This is a sample question asked in an HCL interview.
Input format :

The input consists of two integer values.
