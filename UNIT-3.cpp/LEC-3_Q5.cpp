/* Sri wants to write a program that calculates the sum of two numbers and stores the result in a file named "sum.txt". Sri needs to implement the program using file stream operations. If there is an error opening the file, the program displays an error message on the console.



Note: Sri should ensure that the program has write permissions for the directory where it is executed to create and write to the "sum.txt" file.



Note: This is a sample question asked in a mPhasis interview.

Input format :
The input consists of the two values n1 and n2.

Output format :
The output displays the indicate the message "Sum successfully written to the file 'sum.txt'."

Then following next line the sum of the two input values.



Refer to the sample output for format specifications.

Code constraints :
1<=n1,n2<=50000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3 5
Output 1 :
Sum successfully written to the file 'sum.txt'.
Sum: 8
Input 2 :
100 23
Output 2 :
Sum successfully written to the file 'sum.txt'.
Sum: 123 */
