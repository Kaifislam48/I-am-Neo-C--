/* Saakshi wants to create a C++ program that takes two integer inputs 'a' and 'b' from the user. The program then writes all even numbers from 'a' to 'b' (inclusive) to a file named "even.txt," each on a separate line. Finally, it reads and displays the contents of "even.txt" to the console.

Input format :
The input consists of two space-separated integers: a and b.

Output format :
The output prints all the even numbers present from a to b(inclusive) in separate lines.

Code constraints :
-105 <= a < b <= 105

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
-8 9
Output 1 :
-8
-6
-4
-2

Input 2 :
0 16
Output 2 :
